## Introduction :

This project is an extension of the wor done in Project 3 Phase 3 where the turtlebot is used to simulate the path followed to the goal point using VREP software.

The turtle bot is a two wheeled fifferential drive robot which follown an action set consisting of 8 moves.

There are two configurations: Start points and Goal Points; which are entered in the cartesian co-ordinate system.

1) Video1 depicts:
   Start Point (110,210)  
   Goal Point  (510,210)

2) Video2 depicts:
   Start Point (110,210)  
   Goal Point  (910,810)

## Instructions for Running the Code:

1) The files used in this phase should be placed in the same folder to be run, along with the vrep files :
   a) sim
   b) simConst
   c) simpleTest
   d) remoteApi.dll

2) Open the file phase4.py while simaltaneously keeping open the Turtlebot file which contains the custom    made scene with the obstacle space and the turtlebot robot. 

3) Run the phase4.py file to observe the simulation performed in realtime.

## Challenges Faced :

Due to the difficulty faced when placing or orienting the robot at its initial position the goal coudnt be reached in Video 2. This can also be seen in Video 1 as the turtle bot came very close to the obstacle space while reaching its goal point.
