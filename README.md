## ENPM661: Project 3 Phase 3

## A* Algorithm Implementation on a differential drive

## Authors:

In this project the A* algorithm has been implemented on a turtle bot(non-holonomic)

## External Dependencies:
Matlabplotlib:
To install:```python -m pip install --user matplotlib-1.4.3-cp35-none-win32.whl```

Steps to run the program:
Change the directory on terminal using cd to the file location.
Download the repository from GitHub: https://github.com/AmoghavarshaP/ENPM661-Project-3-Phases-3-4

Running the point robot file: 

``` python Phase3.py ```

The user will asked to input the start and goal points, in terms of x and y coordinates and the orientation. 
In addition, the user will be prompted to input the the radius and clearance of the robot.
Suggested values- (xi,yi,o1,xg,yg,RPM_L,RPM_R):(110,210,30,950,810,50,50) or (110,210,30,510,210,50,50).
The algorithm will run once the goal is found a visual representation of the optimal path will be displayed on the screen.
## Please note: Visualization of the code will take slightly longer time.
